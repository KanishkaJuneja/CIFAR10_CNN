# CIFAR10_CNN
Image classification is a computer vision task that involves categorizing images into predefined classes or categories based on their visual content. It is a type of supervised learning, where the algorithm learns to classify images based on labeled training data. The model is trained on cifar-10 dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The 10 classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset are:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
Each image is 32x32 pixels in size with three color channels (RGB), resulting in a total of 32x32x3 = 3072 values per image. The dataset is commonly used for machine learning and computer vision research, particularly for tasks like image classification, object recognition, and image segmentation.
